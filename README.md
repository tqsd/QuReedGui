# QuReed GUI

This repository contains the code for QuReed GUI. Qureed contains only the 'business logic'.

Depencencies:
	- QuReed GUI relies on the QuReedGUIServer, which is essential for the communication between the GUI and the project runtime. It is responsible for separating the GUI runtime and the project runtime. This prevents the runtime pollution.
